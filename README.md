## About The Game

This is not a joke, this is a serious game  
Help me, why don't you?  
Even people like me get into trouble sometimes  
People make mistakes  
Anyway, I need help fixing mine  
Sometimes I get drunk and do stupid things  
Sometimes I get drunk and poison my entire family  
When that happens, I can't live with the consequences  
Otherwise I will rot in prison  
Regardless  
Don't leave me here  
I need help  
Someone must help me  

Zarf  
Ebb  
Radial drilling machine  
Oafishly  
Did you get all that?  

Yours Faithfully,

### Seriously, About The Game

Justin Wall's Cooking Simulator was designed to be a game stripped down to the absolute bare essentials. The graphics are black and white, the sounds are all made with DisOmikron's voice and the controls are very minimal.

That said, Justin Wall's Cooking Simulator is a reasonably in-depth puzzle game which extends beyond the boundaries of the game itself.

In total, the "game" actually consists of five games.

Each game has two endings, one of which is the "bad" ending and the second is the "good" ending which requires solving an additional puzzle.

The "good" ending will give you additional information about how to access the next game.

To play the next game, you need to both uncover the link to the next game and also a password to access it once you have the link.

### Releases

Justin Wall's Cooking Simulator is available to play in your browser on [itch io](https://eatkin.itch.io/justin-walls-cooking-simulator).

## Source Code

Justin Wall's Cooking Simulator was built using Gamemaker Studio 2.

The game was built a long time ago and successive updates to Gamemaker may cause incompatibilities.

### About the Code

The code for Justin Wall's Cooking Simulator is, unfortunately, unremarkable.

You can, of course, cheat and look up the code for the lock on the shed. But where's the fun in that? After all, the code is in plain sight.
