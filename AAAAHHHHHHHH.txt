Help help why will this never end
I cannot escape from this hell
Must I endlessly travel through time
Not being able to find a place to settle
I know who's fault this is
It is one man's fault
Not my own
If I can escape
The prison
Of my alcoholism
I will find him
I will end him
It is wicKed that I have to endure this
Who else must carry the weight of this trauma
Nobody can know what I am possibly going through
I cannot find the words to dEscribe it
I try my best to vocalise
But all I can do is scream
Life is a torturous existence
The onlY thing that keeps me going is alcoholism
And that is a curse
I cannot escape
Confined
Always needing more
Cannot survive without it
Numbs everything
Makes everything seem okay
Gets rid of my problems
Creates new ones
I will escape
